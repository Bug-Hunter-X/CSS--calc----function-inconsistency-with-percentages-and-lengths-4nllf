The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the `calc()` function with percentages and lengths.  The expected behavior is to calculate 25% of the container's width, add 10 pixels, and then subtract 5% of the container's width. However, this may not work as expected in all browsers.

```css
.element {
  width: calc(25% + 10px - 5%);
}
```
